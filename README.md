# Machine Learning for Biologists (CBB555 F2017)

This repo contains the data and code I wrote for the projects in in CBB555 during the Fall of 2017. I have purposefully removed the completed assignments themselves. Not all of the code in here has the expected behavior, these are just the jupyter notebooks I created along the way.

* [PCA and diffusion maps](https://github.com/isgilman/CBB555/blob/master/gilman_ian_ps1/gilman_ian_ps1.ipynb)
* [Modularity clustering](https://github.com/isgilman/CBB555/blob/master/gilman_ian_ps2/gilman_ian_ps2.ipynb)
* [Feed-forward neural nets and autoencoders](https://github.com/isgilman/CBB555/blob/master/gilman_ian_ps3/gilman_ian_ps3.ipynb)
* [Final project: Modularity based gene tree clustering for reduction of phylogenetic data](https://github.com/isgilman/CBB555/blob/master/gilman_ian_final_project/gilman_ian_final.ipynb)
